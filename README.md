# js-console-tetris
Tetris game written in JS that runs in JS console in your browser!
*Note*: This is beta version of this project.

## TODO
### Gameplay
- spawn tetrinos at the middle of X axis
- spawn all tetrinos at the very top of the board

### Technicalities
- add unit tests
- add sophisticated minification (prepack?)
- add CI/CD (compile, compress and upload to CDN)
